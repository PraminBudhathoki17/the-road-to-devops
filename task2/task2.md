## Task-2: File System Management

- Implement file system management tasks by creating directories, setting permissions, and managing disk usage. Use the directories.csv file provided to automate directory creation and permission setting.

- Problem Statement:

    - Create the directories listed in directories.csv if they do not exist.
    - Set the appropriate file permissions for each directory as specified.
    - Log the actions taken (directory creation and permission changes).

- `directories.csv`: This file lists directories and their associated permissions.
    ```bash
    Folder,Folder Permission
    /home/primeagen,744
    /home/oggy,740
    /home/pranav,440
    /home/pragyik,700
    ```
